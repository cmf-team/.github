CMF Github
==========

This is an organisation to hold and develop computational projects by CMF. 

We see there are two types of projects in CMF Github organisation in 2022:

- open source projects that anyone outside CMF can use and contribute to (eg packages, open learning materials)
- lab projects that are used by CMF teams to complete assignements by tutors

Open source:

- hosted at cmf-team organisation
- open to outsiders
- under review of coding practices
- have suggested project organisation

Lab projects:

- hosted at cmf-team organisation or at personal repos
- project organisation at discretion of tutors and project leads
- survey to fill upon 2022 school year completion (achievements, plans, etc)
